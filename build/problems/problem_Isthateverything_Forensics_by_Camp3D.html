            Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love<br>
            There was nobody that compared to my baby<br>
            And nobody came between us nor could ever come above<br>
            She had me goin' crazy<br>
            Oh, I was starstruck<br>
            She woke me up daily<br>
            Don't need no Starbucks (woo)<br>
            She made my heart pound<br>
            And skip a beat when I see her in the street and<br>
            At school on the playground<br>
            But I really wanna see her on the weekend<br>
            She know she got me dazin'<br>
            'Cause she was so amazin'<br>
