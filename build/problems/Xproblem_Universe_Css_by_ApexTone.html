                    Never has a man influenced physics so profoundly as Niels Bohr in the early 1900's<br />
                    Going back to this time period, little was known about atomic structure; Bohr set out<br />
                    to end the obscurity of physics. However, things didn't come easy for Bohr. He had to<br />
                    give up most of his life for physics and reaearch of many hypothesis. Butm this is why<br />
                    you and I have even heard of the quantum theory and atomic structures. Bohr came<br />
                    up with his quantum theory while studying at Cambridge. Bohr was a skeptic and he<br />
                    never truly believed in Max Planck's old quantum theory. He put forth the idea that,<br />
                    going from one high-energy orbit to a lower one, an electron could, in fact, be trying<br />
                    to emit a quantum of discrete energy. Bohr was criticized for this idea, but he didn't<br />
                    let up. Soon after, Bohr said his famed quote, "If quantum mechanics hasn't shocked <br />
                    you, you haven't understood it yet."This quote is extremely famous and has gone<br />
                    down as the motto for quantum physicist around the world. Understadably, Bohr<br />
                    never won a Nobel prize outside of physics (of which he only won one). Bohr's still<br />
                    going strong with his theories on atomic structure; he allowed for 100's of scientists<br />
                    to fully experiment with the cell and its many components. Bohr was largely on the<br />
                    run from the Nazi's when he came up with this discovery, which is amazing because<br />
                    around this time, Bohr's home country of Denmark was invaded by Nazi's. Bohr<br />
                    and Ernest Rutherford are given credit, but it's believed that Rutherford decided to<br />
                    desert Bohr in the middle ot their work. Rutherford once, quite famously said that<br />
                    you should never bet against the wonders of science. Niel Bohr's famous career<br />
                    never really kicked off until he was forty years old. Most other major scientists were<br />
                    going all over the world with their ideaas by their early twenties. However, in order<br />
                    to preserve the legacy of Niels Bohr, he has his own institution, whose goal is to<br />
                    make many more great strides in the field of physics for years. How did Bohr affect<br />
                    you and me? Without Niels Bohrs' more advenced atomic theory, we might as well<br />
                    cry over how little we know of the atoms and their compounds. Physics would have<br />
                    never been such a force in the todays society. However, to this day, research is still<br />
                    going on to improve and update the atomic theory. Although scientists clearly want<br />
                    to improve on Bohr's theory, many famous physicists come out publicly and openly<br />
                    say that bohr's ideas will never be imporved upon, todays society cannot say<br />
                    goodbye to an opportunity to improved our understanding of the sciences. If Bohr<br />
                    never had silenced his critics, we would still be following Planck's theories, and<br />
                    going on incomplete information. Bohr's later life was all occupied when he decided<br />
                    to go back to Denmark and head the Royal Danish Academy. His main goal was to<br />
                    tell the world of the greatness of the Danish Sciences and most likely educate<br />
                    a new crop of scientists for years to come. There is controversy surrounding Bohr's<br />
                    lie during his stint in the Manhattan Project. Though he claimed to be anti-violence<br />
                    and a peace-seeket, Bohr engineered on the Manhattan Project. Though he didn't<br />
                    hurt anyone directly, thousands of people died. Neils Bohr opened many dorrs for<br />
                    you and I in the physics world, he will go down as one of the greates physicists.<br />
