        The green tea and avocado smoothie turned out exactly as would be
        expected. It's not possible to convince a monkey to give you a banana by
        promising it infinite bananas when they die. The book is in front of the
        table. He turned in the research paper on Friday; otherwise, he would
        have not passed the class. Today I heard something new and unmemorable.
        Don't put peanut butter on the dog's nose. The sign said there was road
        work ahead so he decided to speed up. Iguanas were falling out of the
        trees. His thought process was on so many levels that he gave himself a
        phobia of heights. The blue parrot drove by the hitchhiking mongoose.
        Sometimes it is better to just walk away from things and go back to them
        later when youâ€™re in a better frame of mind. He learned the important
        lesson that a picnic at the beach on a windy day is a bad idea. He
        decided that the time had come to be stronger than any of the excuses
        he'd used until then. When I was little I had a car door slammed shut on
        my hand and I still remember it quite vividly. The thick foliage and
        intertwined vines made the hike nearly impossible. Sixty-Four comes
        asking for bread. Tom got a small piece of pie. When money was tight,
        he'd get his lunch money from the local wishing well. Rock music
        approaches at high velocity. The toy brought back fond memories of being
        lost in the rain forest. The lyrics of the song sounded like fingernails
        on a chalkboard. The shark-infested South Pine channel was the only way
        in or out. She had a habit of taking showers in lemonade. The clouds
        formed beautiful animals in the sky that eventually created a tornado to
        wreak havoc. Doris enjoyed tapping her nails on the table to annoy
        everyone. The two walked down the slot canyon oblivious to the sound of
        thunder in the distance. It took him a while to realize that everything
        he decided not to change, he was actually choosing. Green should have
        smelled more tranquil, but somehow it just tasted rotten. He had a wall
        full of masks so she could wear a different face every day. While on the
        first date he accidentally hit his head on the beam. He poured rocks in
        the dungeon of his mind. It was a slippery slope and he was willing to
        slide all the way to the deepest depths. It doesn't sound like that will
        ever be on my travel list. He decided to live his life by the big beats
        manifesto. He wasn't bitter that she had moved on but from the radish.
        While all her friends were positive that Mary had a sixth sense, she
        knew she actually had a seventh sense. Plans for this weekend include
        turning wine into water. She cried diamonds. Love is not like pizza.
        There was no telling what thoughts would come from the machine. The
        snow-covered path was no help in finding his way out of the
        back-country. He told us a very exciting adventure story. He stepped
        gingerly onto the bridge knowing that enchantment awaited on the other
        side. Happiness can be found in the depths of chocolate pudding. Harrold
        felt confident that nobody would ever suspect his spy pigeon. On a scale
        from one to ten, what's your favorite flavor of random grammar? The
        bullet pierced the window shattering it before missing Danny's head by
        mere millimeters. She couldn't decide of the glass was half empty or
        half full so she drank it. She used her own hair in the soup to give it
        more flavor. Pantyhose and heels are an interesting choice of attire for
        the beach.
